Hello {{first_name}},

Congratulations! Your Google Summer of Code application to stdlib has been accepted.

You have been selected from many very high quality applications (~{{number_of_applications}}).

One very important question first: do you accept the project?

Often applicants apply to many internships. It is not uncommon for a GSoC project to be accepted, only to be withdrawn a couple weeks later due to an applicant accepting a different internship. We'd like to avoid this scenario, as it would likely lead us to lose a slot, despite rejecting other high quality proposals. So if you could please confirm your acceptance now, we'd greatly appreciate it!

Assuming your acceptance, your official mentors are {{mentors}}. We'll be arranging a joint welcome session to welcome you to the project and facilitate introductions. After the welcome session, your mentors will contact you to discuss a schedule for you to meet and discuss your progress throughout the summer. Note that some of these mentors may act as primary mentors, and others may act only as co-mentors or backup mentors. They will discuss with you the roles they will take for your project. If at any point during the summer you are not able to contact one of your mentors, please let me and {{org_admin}} ({{org_admin_email}}) know immediately.

Throughout the program, we'll also aim to hold weekly stand-ups/demo sessions for you to share what you're working on and connect with other stdlib and GSoC contributors.

Here is the official timeline:

GSoC projects have flexible timelines. Right now your project is set to the default timeline for the project length you specified in your proposal. However, should you want/need to extend or contract your timeline, you should discuss that with your mentors, and let me know if you need to make any changes. Note that the timeline *must* follow one of these timelines https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/project-dates.

The community bonding period from {{bonding_start_date}} to {{bonding_stop_date}} begins now.

You should spend this time to get up to speed with the community, and to set up regular meetings with your mentors for the coming months. We'll be inviting you to our internal Slack channel shortly so you can connect with mentors and other maintainers more directly.

Feel free to get a head start during the bonding period, too. If you have obligations, such as examinations during this period, please let us know now.

If you have any problems/questions, please don't hesitate to email me directly at any time.

Once again, congratulations! We're very much looking forward to working with you in the months ahead.

Warm regards,
