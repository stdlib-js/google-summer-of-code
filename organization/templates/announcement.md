Hello everyone!

As many of you may have noticed, Google has announced the results for Google Summer of Code. We are proud to announce that NUMBER_OF_ACCEPTED_APPLICATIONS people have been accepted to work on stdlib this year. The following projects have been accepted:

Contributor, Project: Mentors

FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME, "PROJECT_TITLE". Mentors: MENTOR_NAMES

Join me in congratulating them on their acceptance.

To everyone whose proposal is accepted, you should be receiving an email from your mentors shortly to discuss how you will be communicating over the summer about your project. You should meet with your mentors about once a week during the summer to go over your progress.

I would like all of us to strongly encourage contributors to submit pull requests early and often. This will go a long way toward making sure that you don't end the summer with a ton of code written that never gets merged. Contributors should help review pull requests by other contributors, so that we don't get bogged down reviewing too much code.

The GSoC coding period officially starts May CODING_START_DATE (https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

I would like to thank all of the contributors who applied this year and everyone who submitted a patch. I would also like to thank all the mentors for helping review patches and proposals.

This is looking to be another very productive summer for stdlib, and I'm looking forward to it!

Best,

YOUR_NAME
