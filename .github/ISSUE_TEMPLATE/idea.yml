        Thanks for taking the time to propose a new idea!

        A few general notes:

        1.  Before submitting your idea, please be sure to look through the [list of existing ideas](https://github.com/stdlib-js/google-summer-of-code/issues?q=label%3Aidea+) to ensure that your idea has not already been discussed.

        1.  Also, before submitting your idea, please be sure to reach out over the stdlib [Element channel](https://gitter.im/stdlib-js/stdlib) to discuss it with us first. We'll inform you whether the idea has already been implemented, if the idea will entail enough work to last the duration of the GSoC program, if the idea requires too much work to be meaningfully pursued during GSoC, and if the idea is within the scope of stdlib.

        1.  Understand that submitting an idea is **not** sufficient to participate in GSoC. To be considered, a GSoC application **must** have a written proposal submitted to <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>. To begin working on a GSoC application, we **strongly** recommend using the stdlib [application template](https://github.com/stdlib-js/google-summer-of-code/issues/new?assignees=&labels=rfc%2C2023&template=application.yml&title=%5BRFC%5D%3A+).

        1.  Please use a succinct name to describe your idea. This issue should use the following issue naming convention:

            -   \[Idea]: the succinct name describing your idea

            For example,

            -   \[Idea]: improving the stdlib REPL
            -   \[Idea]: add SIMD support to loop tiling macros

        1.  When describing your idea, you should include the following information, as described below.

  - type: textarea
    id: idea
