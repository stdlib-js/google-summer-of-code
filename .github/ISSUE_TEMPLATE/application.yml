        Thanks for taking the time to complete this application!

        A few general notes:

        1.  Before working on your proposal, be sure to read through [instructions](https://github.com/stdlib-js/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/README.md) first!

        1.  To be considered, a GSoC application **must** have a written proposal submitted to <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>. The purpose of creating this issue is to allow stdlib mentors to provide feedback and answer any questions you have regarding your prospective project proposal. Note, however, that we will **not** write your proposal for you. You, and you alone, are responsible for writing, and the timely submission of, your project proposal.

        1.  Please use a succinct name to describe your proposal. This issue should use the following issue naming convention:

            -   \[RFC]: the succinct name describing your proposal

            For example,

            -   \[RFC]: improve tiling algorithms for element-wise ndarray iteration
            -   \[RFC]: build a developer dashboard for tracking repository build status

        1.  In your proposal, you should include the following information, as described below.

        ## Project Description

        Tell us about your proposal!

        When detailing the project schedule, you are advised to note where along the way you could formulate a pull request. Ideally, pull requests should be points where you can have self-contained, well-documented, and tested pieces of functionality. Breaking the project into smaller sub-tasks which can be completed as part of one or more pull requests helps to keep branch merges and code reviews reasonable. A large code dump at the end of the program will likely be hard to review and merge before the project deadline.

        Please do **not** copy verbatim text from the list of project ideas or from other people's discussions about your project. Always write your proposal in your own words.

        If you include any significant text or code from another source in your application, you must properly cite the included material. All papers or references that you use or plan to use must be cited. Place all citations in a "References" section at the bottom of each appliable application section. Copying text without citation is plagarism and will result in your application being rejected.

        For an example of a well-written and clearly articulated GSoC proposal, see Aaron Meurer's [2009 SymPy GSoC proposal](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2009-Application-Aaron-Meurer).

      label: Schedule
      description: Please provide a weekly schedule of how your time will be spent on the subtasks of the project throughout the GSoC program and the expected deliverables. While this is only preliminary and can be adjusted later, if need be, providing such a schedule will help us monitor your progress throughout the program. During your project, understand that you will issue weekly progress reports against the proposed schedule on your blog. If you aim to perform any prepwork prior to week 1 (e.g., during the community bonding period), be sure to include that in your answer below. The template below assumes a 12 week schedule. If you are doing an alternate schedule, you can adjust the template accordingly.

        Assuming a 12 week schedule,

        - **Community Bonding Period**:

        - **Week 1**:

        - **Week 2**:

        - **Week 3**:

        - **Week 4**:

        - **Week 5**:

        - **Week 6**: (midterm)

        - **Week 7**:

        - **Week 8**:

        - **Week 9**:

        - **Week 10**:

        - **Week 11**:

        - **Week 12**:

        - **Final Week**:

        Notes:

        - The community bonding period is a 3 week period built into GSoC to help you get to know the project community and participate in project discussion. This is an opportunity for you to setup your local development environment, learn how the project's source control works, refine your project plan, read any necessary documentation, and otherwise prepare to execute on your project project proposal.
        - Usually, even week 1 deliverables include some code.
        - By week 6, you need enough done at this point for your mentor to evaluate your progress and pass you. Usually, you want to be a bit more than halfway done.
        - By week 11, you may want to "code freeze" and focus on completing any tests and/or documentation.
        - During the final week, you'll be submitting your project.
